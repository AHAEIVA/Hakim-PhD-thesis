\section{Marine Robotics: Advancing Autonomy for Underwater and Aerial Applications Through Optimal Control}

Marine robotics encompasses a diverse array of platforms, including remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (see Fig. \ref{fig:underwater_robotics_applications}). These systems are increasingly vital across multiple domains. In the energy sector, they can perform essential inspections of offshore wind turbines and subsea pipelines, detecting critical structural defects or leaks. Beyond industry, applications span environmental monitoring, archaeological surveying, scientific research, and defense operations like mine countermeasures and surveillance.

Currently, many marine robotic tasks depend on remote control (teleoperation) or semi-autonomous functions, such as executing pre-programmed paths or simple line-following maneuvers. While effective for specific, well-defined tasks, these modes often necessitate skilled human pilots and constant supervision, limiting mission duration, complexity, and operational range.

The drive towards fully autonomous marine systems stems from the need to enhance operational safety, increase mission efficiency and capability, and reduce operational costs. By minimizing direct human intervention, autonomy mitigates the risk of human error, enables longer and more complex missions in challenging environments, and ultimately lowers operational expenses.


% --- Challenges to Autonomy ---
Achieving reliable underwater autonomy, however, requires overcoming fundamental challenges inherent to the complex and dynamic marine environment. Key among these are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Safe Navigation:} Ensuring safe navigation is essential, including robust obstacle avoidance and adherence to physical constraints. Many marine robots are tethered, so preventing tether entanglement during operation is a critical safety consideration.

    \item \textbf{Precise and Robust Trajectory Following:} The ability to accurately follow desired trajectories under disturbances such as ocean currents is fundamental for mission success in complex marine environments.

    \item \textbf{Generalizability Across Different Platforms:} Control and planning methods should transfer across a wide range of robotic platforms—such as UAVs, AUVs, and systems with varying sizes and degrees of freedom—without the need for substantial redesign or tuning.
\end{itemize}
