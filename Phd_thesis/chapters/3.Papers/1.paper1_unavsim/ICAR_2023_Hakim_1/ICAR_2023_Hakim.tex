\begin{abstract}
%Underwater robotics tests are expensive due to the complex working environment and requirement for various sensor modalities in the underwater domain. Even though underwater simulators are a must, the rendering quality of many existing simulators is inadequate, limiting their ability to transfer algorithms from simulation to real-world applications. We introduce UNav-Sim, to overcome this limitation. To the best of our knowledge, UNav-Sim is the first simulator to incorporate the efficient, high-detail rendering of unreal engine 5 (UE5). It is open-source\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Zartris/ColosseumUnderWater}} and includes an autonomous control and vision-based navigation framework. Furthermore, Hydr-Sim makes use of AirSim's advanced features, such as its efficient physics solver and diverse sensor models, including GPS, IMU, cameras, and sonar. To enable communication between the autonomy framework and the physics simulator, an API can be utilized in either C++ or Python to transfer essential sensor data and issue control commands. Additionally, the C++ client library can be interfaced with a ROS wrapper, enabling researchers to efficiently develop and test their algorithms underwater and transfer them to real-world systems. 

%, it suppor enabling researchers to efficiently develop and test their algorithms underwater and transfer them to real-world systems. 

%Marine robotics simulators are essential for advancing robotics research as they enable rapid algorithm testing without the cost and complexity of real-time experiments. In addition, they can provide accurate positioning data, which is often unavailable in the real world. However, the rendering quality of many existing simulators is inadequate, limiting their ability to transfer algorithms from simulation to real-world applications. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \ac{UWRS}, a new simulator for autonomous underwater robotics research that extends the popular drone simulator AirSim. \ac{UWRS} is the first simulator of its kind to incorporate the efficient, high-detail rendering of \ac{UE5}. It is open-source and includes an autonomous control and vision-based navigation framework, enabling researchers to efficiently develop and test their algorithms and transfer them to real-world systems.

Although underwater simulators are essential, many existing simulators have inadequate rendering quality, which limits their ability to transfer algorithms from simulation to real-world applications. 

Underwater robotic surveys can be costly due to the complex working environment and the need for various sensor modalities. While underwater simulators are essential, many existing simulators lack sufficient rendering quality, restricting their ability to transfer algorithms from simulation to real-world applications. To address this limitation, we introduce UNav-Sim, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first simulator to incorporate the efficient, high-detail rendering of Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). UNav-Sim is open-source\footnote{\url{https://github.com/open-airlab/UNav-Sim}} and includes an autonomous vision-based navigation stack. By supporting standard robotics tools like ROS, UNav-Sim enables researchers to develop and test algorithms for underwater environments efficiently.% It also facilitates the easy transfer of these algorithms from simulation to real-world systems.
