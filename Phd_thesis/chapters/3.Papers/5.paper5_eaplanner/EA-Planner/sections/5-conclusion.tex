\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented \ac{REACT} a real-time entanglement-aware path planning framework for tethered \ac{ROV}'s operating in constrained underwater environments. Through comparative simulations, we demonstrated that while conventional planners may complete missions faster, they lack the ability to handle tether-related challenges effectively. \ac{REACT} mitigates potential entanglement through reactive replanning, offering a more robust and reliable solution. Despite a moderate increase in execution time, the entanglement-aware planner enhances mission safety and integrityâ€”making it a preferable choice for high-risk, cluttered inspection scenarios where tether management is critical. 

As future work, an experimental validation setup will be established to evaluate \ac{REACT} in a controlled underwater environment. 



%Furture work will involve creating a ros plugin and integration with the UNav-sim simulator.
