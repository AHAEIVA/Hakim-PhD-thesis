	abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This signiﬁcantly reduces the training time in feedforward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

	abstract = {The remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are important to provide the technology support for both the traditional offshore structures and rapidly-growing renewable energy facilities during their full-lifecycles, such as site survey, installation, inspection, maintenance and repair. Regarding the motion and performance of a ROV, the understanding of its hydrodynamic properties is essential when exposing to the disturbances of wave and current. In this study, a numerical model is proposed within the frame of an open-source platform OpenFOAM. The hydrodynamics of the adopted ROV (BlueRov2) in its four principal degrees of freedoms (DOFs) is numerically simulated by a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver. Meanwhile, an experimental test is carried out by using a novel technique on measuring the hydrodynamic forces and moments. To validate the numerical prediction methodologies, a set of systematic simulations of the ROV subjected to the disturbances caused by various flow conditions are performed. Comparing to the model test measurement, the numerical model proved to be reliable in offering a good estimation of the hydrodynamic parameters. This also indicates that the presented numerical methodologies and experimental techniques can be applied to other types of open-frame ROVs in quantifying the hydrodynamic parameters, capturing the physics of the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) and feature of the turbulent vorticity which are all essential for the effective control of the ROVs under the nonlinear flow disturbances.},

The BlueROV2 model is based on Fossen’s equations and includes a kinematic model of the vehicle, the hydrodynamics of vehicle and water interaction, a dynamic model of the thrusters, and, lastly, the gravitational/buoyant forces. The hydrodynamic parameters and thruster model have been validated in a test facility. The benchmark model also includes the ocean current, modeled as constant velocity. The tether connecting the ROV to the top-site facility has been modeled using the lumped mass method and is implemented as a force input to the ROV model. At last, to show the usefulness of the benchmark model, a case study is presented where a BlueROV2 is deployed to inspect an offshore monopile structure. The case study uses a sliding mode controller designed for the BlueROV2. The controller fulfills the design criteria defined for the case study by following the provided trajectory with a low error. It is concluded that the simulator establishes a benchmark for future control schemes for position control and trajectory tracking under the influence of environmental disturbances.},

	title = {{TOWARDS} {IMPARTIAL} {MULTI}-{TASK} {LEARNING}},
	abstract = {Multi-task learning (MTL) has been widely used in representation learning. However, na¨ıvely training all tasks simultaneously may lead to the partial training issue, where speciﬁc tasks are trained more adequately than others. In this paper, we propose to learn multiple tasks impartially. Speciﬁcally, for the task-shared parameters, we optimize the scaling factors via a closed-form solution, such that the aggregated gradient (sum of raw gradients weighted by the scaling factors) has equal projections onto individual tasks. For the task-speciﬁc parameters, we dynamically weigh the task losses so that all of them are kept at a comparable scale. Further, we ﬁnd the above gradient balance and loss balance are complementary and thus propose a hybrid balance method to further improve the performance. Our impartial multi-task learning (IMTL) can be end-to-end trained without any heuristic hyper-parameter tuning, and is general to be applied on all kinds of losses without any distribution assumption. Moreover, our IMTL can converge to similar results even when the task losses are designed to have different scales, and thus it is scale-invariant. We extensively evaluate our IMTL on the standard MTL benchmarks including Cityscapes, NYUv2 and CelebA. It outperforms existing loss weighting methods under the same experimental settings.},

Based on the identiﬁed healthy ODE, the extra fault terms in the ODE of the faulty rotor system are then sparsely regressed from the predeﬁned library embedded in HPINN.

This study presents a pioneering integration of Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a PhysicsInformed Neural Network (PINN), aiming to enhance control system precision and operational efficiency in AUVs. The efficacy of MPC lies in its adept handling of the intricate constraints and inherent nonlinear dynamics intrinsic to AUV systems. Concurrently, the PINN architecture incorporates the fundamental physical laws represented by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), augmenting the predictive fidelity of the system. Firstly, this research implements the novel PINN-enhanced MPC framework for trajectory tracking and conducts a comparative evaluation against adaptive proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and Gaussian-process-based MPC controllers. This comparative analysis elucidates the advancements in control mechanisms attributable to the PINN integration. Furthermore, this study meticulously assesses the PINN-MPC’s proficiency in navigating through static and dynamic obstacles within three-dimensional marine environments, a critical capability for AUV operations. Through extensive and meticulous simulations, the proposed approach demonstrates notable progress in overcoming environmental challenges and executing intricate operational tasks, such as obstacle avoidance, with heightened efficiency and dexterity. This research constitutes a substantial contribution to the theoretical advancement and elucidation of control systems in the AUV domain, bearing profound practical implications. It lays the foundation for the development of increasingly sophisticated, advanced, and reliable AUV missions, signifying a crucial advancement in the realms of underwater exploration and operational technology.},

Two of the main challenges remaining in DMD research are noise sensitivity and issues related to Krylov space closure when modeling nonlinear systems. Here, we investigate the combination of noise and nonlinearity in a controlled setting, by studying a class of systems with linear latent dynamics which are observed via multinomial observables. Our numerical models include system and measurement noise. We explore the influences of dataset metrics, the spectrum of the latent dynamics, the normality of the system matrix, and the geometry of the dynamics. Our results show that even for these very mildly nonlinear conditions, DMD methods often fail to recover the spectrum and can have poor predictive ability. Our work is motivated by our experience modeling multilegged robot data, where we have encountered great difficulty in reconstructing time series for oscillatory systems with slow transients, which decay only slightly faster than a period.},

	abstract = {Understanding real-world dynamical phenomena remains a challenging task. Across various scientific disciplines, machine learning has advanced as the go-to technology to analyze nonlinear dynamical systems, identify patterns in big data, and make decision around them. Neural networks are now consistently used as universal function approximators for data with underlying mechanisms that are incompletely understood or exceedingly complex. However, neural networks alone ignore the fundamental laws of physics and often fail to make plausible predictions. Here we integrate data, physics, and uncertainties by combining neural networks, physics informed modeling, and Bayesian inference to improve the predictive potential of traditional neural network models. We embed the physical model of a damped harmonic oscillator into a fully-connected feed-forward neural network to explore a simple and illustrative model system, the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19. Our Physics Informed Neural Networks seamlessly integrate data and physics, robustly solve forward and inverse problems, and perform well for both interpolation and extrapolation, even for a small amount of noisy and incomplete data. At only minor additional cost, they self-adaptively learn the weighting between data and physics. They can serve as priors in a Bayesian Inference, and provide credible intervals for uncertainty quantification. Our study reveals the inherent advantages and disadvantages of Neural Networks, Bayesian Inference, and a combination of both and provides valuable guidelines for model selection. While we have only demonstrated these different approaches for the simple model problem of a seasonal endemic infectious disease, we anticipate that the underlying concepts and trends generalize to more complex disease conditions and, more broadly, to a wide variety of nonlinear dynamical systems.

However, these networks can be difficult or impossible to train accurately for some systems of equations. We present a novel multifidelity framework for stacking physics-informed neural networks and operator networks that facilitates training. We successively build a chain of networks, where the output at one step can act as a low-fidelity input for training the next step, gradually increasing the expressivity of the learned model. The equations imposed at each step of the iterative process can be the same or different (akin to simulated annealing). The iterative (stacking) nature of the proposed method allows us to progressively learn features of a solution that are hard to learn directly. Through benchmark problems including a nonlinear pendulum, the wave equation, and the viscous Burgers equation, we show how stacking can be used to improve the accuracy and reduce the required size of physics-informed neural networks and operator networks.},

This innovation has become instrumental in solving diverse problem sets including PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. It's a versatile multi-task learning framework that tasks NNs with fitting observed data while simultaneously minimizing PDE residuals. This paper delves into the landscape of PINNs, aiming to delineate their inherent strengths and weaknesses. Beyond exploring the fundamental characteristics of these networks, this review endeavors to encompass a wider spectrum of collocation-based physics-informed neural networks, extending beyond the core PINN model. Variants like physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN) constitute pivotal aspects of this exploration. The study accentuates a predominant focus in research on tailoring PINNs through diverse strategies: adapting activation functions, refining gradient optimization techniques, innovating neural network structures, and enhancing loss function architectures. Despite the extensive applicability demonstrated by PINNs, surpassing classical numerical methods like Finite Element Method (FEM) in certain contexts, the review highlights ongoing opportunities for advancement. Notably, there are persisting theoretical challenges that demand resolution, ensuring the continued evolution and refinement of this revolutionary approach.},

However, ensuring the reliability of their convergence and accuracy remains a challenge. In this work, we propose an efficient, gradient-less weighting scheme for PINNs that accelerates the convergence of dynamic or static systems. This simple yet effective attention mechanism is a bounded function of the evolving cumulative residuals and aims to make the optimizer aware of problematic regions at no extra computational cost or adversarial learning. We illustrate that this general method consistently achieves one order of magnitude faster convergence than vanilla PINNs and a minimum relative ��2 error of (10−5), on typical benchmarks of the literature. The method is further tested on the inverse solution of the Navier–Stokes within the brain perivascular spaces, where it considerably improves the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, an ablation study is performed for each case to identify the contribution of the components that enhance the vanilla PINN formulation. Evident from the convergence trajectories is the ability of the optimizer to effectively escape from poor local minima or saddle points while focusing on the challenging domain regions, which consistently have a high residual score. We believe that alongside exact boundary conditions and other model reparameterizations, this type of attention mask could be an essential element for fast training of both PINNs and neural operators.},

As compared to laborious analytical and computational tools, a single neural operator can predict solutions of PDEs for varying initial or boundary conditions and different inputs without repeated independent runs from scratch. A recently proposed Wavelet Neural Operator (WNO) is one such operator that harnesses the advantage of time–frequency localization of wavelets to capture the manifolds in the spatial domain effectively. While WNO has proven to be a promising method for operator learning, the data-hungry nature of the framework is a major shortcoming. Relying completely on conventional solvers for data generation and subsequently training operators with generated data leads to a time-consuming and challenging implementation of the operators in practical applications. In this work, we propose a physics-informed WNO for learning the solution operators of families of parametric PDEs without labeled training data. The efficacy of the framework is validated and illustrated with four nonlinear spatiotemporal systems relevant to various fields of engineering and science.},

	abstract = {This work presents a multi-resolution physics-informed recurrent neural network (MR PI-RNN), for simultaneous prediction of musculoskeletal (MSK) motion and parameter identiﬁcation of the MSK systems. The MSK application was selected as the model problem due to its challenging nature in mapping the high-frequency surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to the low-frequency body joint motion controlled by the MSK and muscle contraction dynamics. The proposed method utilizes the fast wavelet transform to decompose the mixed frequency input sEMG and output joint motion signals into nested multi-resolution signals. The prediction model is subsequently trained on coarser-scale input–output signals using a gated recurrent unit (GRU), and then the trained parameters are transferred to the next level of training with ﬁner-scale signals. These training processes are repeated recursively under a transfer-learning fashion until the full-scale training (i.e., with unﬁltered signals) is achieved, while satisfying the underlying dynamic equilibrium. Numerical examples on recorded subject data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in generating a physics-informed forward-dynamics surrogate, which yields higher accuracy in motion predictions of elbow ﬂexion–extension of an MSK system compared to the case with single-scale training. The framework is also capable of identifying muscle parameters that are physiologically consistent with the subject’s kinematics data.},

While conceptually straightforward, they often suﬀer training difﬁculties that lead to relatively large discretization errors or the failure to obtain correct solutions. In this paper we introduce invariant physics-informed neural networks for ordinary diﬀerential equations that admit a ﬁnite-dimensional group of Lie point symmetries. Using the method of equivariant moving frames, a diﬀerential equation is invariantized to obtain a, generally, simpler equation in the space of diﬀerential invariants. A solution to the invariantized equation is then mapped back to a solution of the original diﬀerential equation by solving the reconstruction equations for the left moving frame. The invariantized diﬀerential equation together with the reconstruction equations are solved using a physics-informed neural network, and form what we call an invariant physics-informed neural network. We illustrate the method with several examples, all of which considerably outperform standard non-invariant physics-informed neural networks.},

            Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a fundamental role in the mathematical modelling of many processes and systems in physical, biological and other sciences. To simulate such processes and systems, the solutions of PDEs often need to be approximated numerically. The finite element method, for instance, is a usual standard methodology to do so. The recent success of deep neural networks at various approximation tasks has motivated their use in the numerical solution of PDEs. These so-called physics-informed neural networks and their variants have shown to be able to successfully approximate a large range of PDEs. So far, physics-informed neural networks and the finite element method have mainly been studied in isolation of each other. In this work, we compare the methodologies in a systematic computational study. Indeed, we employ both methods to numerically solve various linear and nonlinear PDEs: Poisson in 1D, 2D and 3D, Allen–Cahn in 1D, semilinear Schrödinger in 1D and 2D. We then compare computational costs and approximation accuracies. In terms of solution time and accuracy, physics-informed neural networks have not been able to outperform the finite element method in our study. In some experiments, they were faster at evaluating the solved PDE.},

Due to the variable road conditions and the high cost of data acquisition, both physics-based and data-driven models face significant challenges with sparse data. To address this issue, we propose a vehicle model that combines the single-track model with physics-informed neural network methods. Firstly, we encode the single-track model in a physics-based computational graph to identify the key parameters in the physical model. Then, we use these parameters to calibrate the single-track model, which is again encoded in a physics-based computational graph to design a physics-informed neural network for vehicle dynamics modeling (PINN-VM). The PINN-VM leverages the advantages of model-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve accurate vehicle dynamics modeling. Compared to models without physics, PINN-VM performs better, especially in situations with sparse data. Finally, the PINN-VM is incorporated into a novel model predictive control framework to design a trajectory tracking controller. Simulation experiments using CarSim and Simulink demonstrate that the proposed controller enhances trajectory tracking performance and lateral stability under the condition of large curvature at medium-high velocity with different friction coefficients.},

Structural identiﬁcation problems often entail complex setups featuring high-dimensionality, or stiff ODEs, which pose diﬃculties in the training and learning of conventional data-driven algorithms who seek to unveil the governing dynamics of a system of interest. In this work, Neural ODEs are re-casted as a two-level representation involving a physics-informed term, that stems from possible prior knowledge of a dynamical system, and a discrepancy term, captured by means of a feedforward neural network. The re-casted format is highly adaptive and ﬂexible to structural monitoring problems, such as linear/nonlinear structural identiﬁcation, model updating, structural damage detection, driving force identiﬁcation, etc. As an added step, for inferring an explainable model, we propose the adoption of sparse identiﬁcation of nonlinear dynamical systems as an additional tool to distill closed-form expressions for the trained nets, that embed a more straightforward engineering interpretation. We demonstrate the framework on a series of numerical and experimental examples, with the latter pertaining to a structural system featuring highly nonlinear behavior, which is successfully learned by the proposed framework.

	abstract = {The ability to accurately approximate trajectories of dynamical systems enables their analysis, prediction, and control. Neural network (NN)-based approximations have attracted significant interest due to fast evaluation with good accuracy over long integration time steps. In contrast to established numerical approximation schemes such as Runge-Kutta methods, the estimation of the error of the NN-based approximations proves to be difficult. In this work, we propose to use the NN's predictions in a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) method. The residuals in the implicit system of equations can be related to the NN's prediction error, hence, we can provide an error estimate at several points along a trajectory. We find that this error estimate highly correlates with the NN's prediction error and that increasing the order of the IRK method improves this estimate. We demonstrate this estimation methodology for Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) on the logistic equation as an illustrative example and then apply it to a four-state electric generator model that is regularly used in power system modelling.},

	abstract = {Accurately modeling soft robots in simulation is computationally expensive and commonly falls short of representing the real world. This well-known discrepancy, known as the sim-to-real gap, can have several causes, such as coarsely approximated geometry and material models, manufacturing defects, viscoelasticity and plasticity, and hysteresis effects. Residual physics networks learn from real-world data to augment a discrepant model and bring it closer to reality. Here, we present a residual physics method for modeling soft robots with large degrees of freedom. We train neural networks to learn a residual term — the modeling error between simulated and physical systems. Concretely, the residual term is a force applied on the whole simulated mesh, while real position data is collected with only sparse motion markers. The physical prior of the analytical simulation provides a starting point for the residual network, and the combined model is more informed than if physics were learned tabula rasa. We demonstrate our method on 1) a silicone elastomeric beam and 2) a soft pneumatic arm with hard-to-model, anisotropic fiber reinforcements. Our method outperforms traditional system identification up to 60\%. We show that residual physics need not be limited to low degrees of freedom but can effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap for high dimensional systems.},

In particular, forward and inverse problems for the Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved using nondimensional equations with the physics-informed loss function. Higher order complex beam PDEs are efficiently solved for forward problems to compute the transverse displacements and cross-sectional rotations with less than 1e-3 \% error. Furthermore, inverse problems are robustly solved to determine the unknown dimensionless model parameters and applied force in the entire space–time domain, even in the case of noisy data. The results suggest that PINNs are a promising strategy for solving problems in engineering structures and machines involving beam systems.},

As opposed to purely data-driven methods, PIML models can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing physical laws such as energy and mass conservation. More broadly, PIML models can include abstract properties and conditions such as stability, convexity, or invariance. The basic premise of PIML is that the integration of ML and physics can yield more effective, physically consistent, and data-efficient models. This paper aims to provide a tutoriallike overview of the recent advances in PIML for dynamical system modeling and control. Specifically, the paper covers an overview of the theory, fundamental concepts and methods, tools, and applications on topics of: 1) physics-informed learning for system identification; 2) physics-informed learning for control; 3) analysis and verification of PIML models; and 4) physicsinformed digital twins.

	abstract = {Recent advances in aerial robotics have enabled the use of multirotor vehicles for autonomous payload transportation. Resorting only to classical methods to reliably model a quadrotor carrying a cable-slung load poses significant challenges. On the other hand, purely data-driven learning methods do not comply by design with the problem’s physical constraints, especially in states that are not densely represented in training data. In this work, we explore the use of physicsinformed neural networks to learn an end-to-end model of the multirotor-slung-load system and, at a given time, estimate a sequence of the future system states. An LSTM encoderdecoder with an attention mechanism is used to capture the dynamics of the system. To guarantee the cohesiveness between the multiple predicted states of the system, we propose the use of a physics-based term in the loss function, which includes a discretized physical model derived from first principles together with slack variables that allow for a small mismatch between expected and predicted values. To train the model, a dataset using a real-world quadrotor carrying a slung load was curated and is made available. Prediction results are presented and corroborate the feasibility of the approach. The proposed method outperforms both the first principles physical model and a comparable neural network model trained without the physics regularization proposed.},

	abstract = {Collaborative robots are increasingly being used in dynamic and semi-structured environments because of their ability to perform physical Human–Robot Interaction (pHRI) to ensure safety. Therefore, it is crucial to model the dynamics of collaborative robots during pHRI to gain valuable insights into the system’s behavior when in contact with humans. In this work, a generic dynamic model is proposed for the quasi-static contact phase of pHRI, which considers the interaction dynamics and the complete structural dynamics of the collaborative robot. Moreover, a hybrid physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed, which utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) and the Runge–Kutta method to identify the joint dynamic parameters without complicated regressor construction. Experiments are conducted using a UR3e collaborative robot, and the PINN is trained using the acquired data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PINN in identifying joint dynamics without prior knowledge, and the dynamic simulation of pHRI is consistent with the experimental results. The proposed model and PINN-based identification approach have the potential to improve safety and productivity in industrial environments by facilitating the control of pHRI.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are trained using physical equations and can also incorporate unmodeled effects by learning from data. PINNs for control (PINCs) of dynamical systems are gaining interest due to their prediction speed compared to classical numerical integration methods for nonlinear state-space models, making them suitable for real-time control applications. We introduce the domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) to address current limitations of PINC in handling large and complex nonlinear dynamic systems. The time domain is decoupled from the feed-forward neural network to construct an Ansatz function, allowing for calculation of gradients in closed form. This approach significantly reduces training times, especially for large dynamical systems, compared to PINC, which relies on graph-based automatic differentiation. Additionally, the DD-PINN inherently fulfills the initial condition and supports higher-order excitation inputs, simplifying the training process and enabling improved prediction accuracy. Validation on three systems - a nonlinear mass-spring-damper, a five-mass-chain, and a two-link robot - demonstrates that the DD-PINN achieves significantly shorter training times. In cases where the PINC's prediction diverges, the DD-PINN's prediction remains stable and accurate due to higher physics loss reduction or use of a higher-order excitation input. The DD-PINN allows for fast and accurate learning of large dynamical systems previously out of reach for the PINC.},

As a model-based optimal control technique, the performance of MPC strongly depends on the model used where a trade-off between model computation time and prediction performance exists. One solution is the integration of MPC with a machine learning (ML) based process model which are quick to evaluate online. This work presents the experimental implementation of a deep neural network (DNN) based nonlinear MPC for Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion control. The DNN model consists of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network surrounded by fully connected layers which was trained using experimental engine data and showed acceptable prediction performance with under 5\% error for all outputs. Using this model, the MPC is designed to track the Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) and combustion phasing trajectories, while minimizing several parameters. Using the acados software package to enable the real-time implementation of the MPC on an ARM Cortex A72, the optimization calculations are completed within 1.4 ms. The external A72 processor is integrated with the prototyping engine controller using a UDP connection allowing for rapid experimental deployment of the NMPC. The IMEP trajectory following of the developed controller was excellent, with a root-mean-square error of 0.133 bar, in addition to observing process constraints.},

	abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a state-of-the-art (SOTA) control technique which requires solving hard constrained optimization problems iteratively. For uncertain dynamics, analytical model based robust MPC imposes additional constraints, increasing the hardness of the problem. The problem exacerbates in performance-critical applications, when more compute is required in lesser time. Data-driven regression methods such as Neural Networks have been proposed in the past to approximate system dynamics. However, such models rely on high volumes of labeled data, in the absence of symbolic analytical priors. This incurs non-trivial training overheads. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained traction for approximating non-linear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), with reasonable accuracy. In this work, we propose a Robust Adaptive MPC framework via PINNs (RAMP-Net), which uses a neural network trained partly from simple ODEs and partly from data. A physics loss is used to learn simple ODEs representing ideal dynamics. Having access to analytical functions inside the loss function acts as a regularizer, enforcing robust behavior for parametric uncertainties. On the other hand, a regular data loss is used for adapting to residual disturbances (non-parametric uncertainties), unaccounted during mathematical modelling. Experiments are performed in a simulated environment for trajectory tracking of a quadrotor. We report 7.8\% to 43.2\% and 8.04\% to 61.5\% reduction in tracking errors for speeds ranging from 0.5 to 1.75 m/s compared to two SOTA regression based MPC methods.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has been widely used within learning algorithms for robotics. One disadvantage of deep networks is that these networks are black-box representations. Therefore, the learned approximations ignore the existing knowledge of physics or robotics. Especially for learning dynamics models, these black-box models are not desirable as the underlying principles are well understood and the standard deep networks can learn dynamics that violate these principles. To learn dynamics models with deep networks that guarantee physically plausible dynamics, we introduce physics-inspired deep networks that combine first principles from physics with deep learning. We incorporate Lagrangian mechanics within the model learning such that all approximated models adhere to the laws of physics and conserve energy. Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) parametrize the system energy using two networks. The parameters are obtained by minimizing the squared residual of the Euler–Lagrange differential equation. Therefore, the resulting model does not require specific knowledge of the individual system, is interpretable, and can be used as a forward, inverse, and energy model. Previously these properties were only obtained when using system identification techniques that require knowledge of the kinematic structure. We apply DeLaN to learning dynamics models and apply these models to control simulated and physical rigid body systems. The results show that the proposed approach obtains dynamics models that can be applied to physical systems for real-time control. Compared to standard deep networks, the physics-inspired models learn better models and capture the underlying structure of the dynamics.},

Modeling and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with four rotors fall into that category of problems. In this paper, a nonlinear quadrotor UAV dynamical model is developed with the Newton–Euler method, and a control architecture is proposed for 3D trajectory tracking. The controller design is decoupled into two parts: an inner loop for attitude stabilization and an outer loop for trajectory tracking. A few attitude stabilization methods are discussed, implemented and compared, considering the following control approaches: Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID), Linear–Quadratic Regulator (LQR), Model Predictive Control (MPC), Feedback Linearization (FL) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC). This paper is intended to serve as a guideline work for selecting quadcopters’ control strategies, both in terms of quantitative and qualitative considerations. PID and LQR controllers are designed, exploiting the model linearized about the hovering condition, while MPC, FL and SMC directly exploit the nonlinear model, with minor simplifications. The fast dynamics ensured by the SMC-based controller together with its robustness and the limited estimated command effort of the controller make it the most promising controller for quadrotor attitude stabilization. The outer loop consists of three independent PID controllers: one for altitude control and the other two, together with a dynamics’ inversion, are entitled to the computation of the reference attitude for the inner loop. The capability of the controlled closed-loop system of executing complex trajectories is demonstrated by means of simulations in MATLAB/Simulink®.},

Computer-aided mechanical analysis tools, including multibody dynamics software, are very versatile and have revolutionalized many industries. However, as shown by the literature presented in this review, combining the advantages of multibody system dynamics and machine learning creates new and exciting possibilities. For example, the multibody method can assist machine learning by providing synthetic data, while machine learning can provide fast and accurate subsystem models. The intersection of both approaches results in surrogate and hybrid modeling techniques, advanced control algorithms, and optimal design applications. A notable example is the development of autonomous systems for vehicles, robots, and mobile machinery. In our review we have found nontrivial, innovative, and even surprising applications of machine learning and multibody dynamics.

We propose algorithms for model-based policy iterations to solve nonlinear optimal control problems with convergence guarantees. The main component of our approach is an iterative procedure that utilizes neural approximations to solve linear partial differential equations (PDEs), ensuring convergence. We present two variants of the algorithms. The first variant formulates the optimization problem as a linear least square problem, drawing inspiration from extreme learning machine (ELM) for solving PDEs. This variant efficiently handles low-dimensional problems with high accuracy. The second variant is based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving PDEs and has the potential to address high-dimensional problems. We demonstrate that both algorithms outperform traditional approaches, such as Galerkin methods, by a significant margin. We provide a theoretical analysis of both algorithms in terms of convergence of neural approximations towards the true optimal solutions in a general setting.

	abstract = {Predictive modeling of various systems around the world is extremely essential from the physics and engineering perspectives. The recognition of different systems and the capacity to predict their future behavior can lead to numerous significant applications. For the most part, physics is frequently used to model different systems. Using physical modeling can also very well help the resolution of complexity and achieve superior performance with the emerging field of novel artificial intelligence and the challenges associated with it. Physical modeling provides data and knowledge that offer a meaningful and complementary understanding about the system. So, by using enriched data and training phases, the overall general integrated model achieves enhanced accuracy. The effectiveness of hybrid physics-guided or machine learning-guided models has been validated by experimental results of diverse use cases. Increased accuracy, interpretability, and transparency are the results of such hybrid models. In this article, we provide a detailed overview of how machine learning and physics can be integrated into an interactive approach. Regarding this, we propose a classification of possible interactions between physical modeling and machine learning techniques. Our classification includes three types of approaches: (1)\&nbsp;physics-guided machine learning (2)\&nbsp;machine learning-guided physics, and (3)\&nbsp;mutually-guided physics and ML. We studied the models and specifications for each of these three approaches in-depth for this survey.},

	abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-0384.vidPhysics-Infused Machine Learning (PIML) architectures aim at integrating machine learning with computationally-efficient, low-fidelity (partial) physics models, leading to improved generalizability, extrapolability, and robustness to noise, compared to pure data-driven approximation models. End-uses of PIML include, but are not limited to, model-based optimization and model-predictive control. Recently a new PIML architecture was reported by the same authors, known as Opportunistic Physics-mining Transfer Mapping Architecture or OPTMA, which transfers the original inputs into latent features using a transfer neural network; the partial physics model then uses the latent features to generate the final output that is as close as possible to the high-fidelity output. While gradient-free solvers and back-propagation with supervised learning (where optimum labels are pre-generated) have been used to train OPTMA, that approach remains computationally inefficient, and challenging to generalize across different problems or exploit state-of-the-art machine learning architectures. This paper aims to alleviate these issues by infusing the partial physics model inside the neural network, as described via tensors in the popular machine learning framework, PyTorch. Such a description also naturally allows auto-differentiation of the partial physics model, thereby enabling the use of efficient back-propagation methods to train the transfer network. The benefits of the upgraded OPTMA architecture with Automatic Differentiation (OPTMA-Net) is demonstrated by applying it to the problem of modeling the sound pressure field created by a hovering unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Ground truth data for this problem has been obtained from an indoor UAV noise measurement setup. Here, the partial physics model is based on the interference of acoustic pressure waves generated by an arbitrary number of acoustic monopole sources. Case studies show that OPTMA-Net provides generalization performance close to, and extrapolation performance that is 4 times better than, those given by a pure data-driven model.},

	abstract = {This work develops a methodology for creating a data-driven digital twin from a library of physics-based models representing various asset states. The digital twin is updated using interpretable machine learning. Specifically, we use optimal trees---a recently developed scalable machine learning method---to train an interpretable data-driven classifier. Training data for the classifier are generated offline using simulated scenarios solved by the library of physics-based models. These data can be further augmented using experimental or other historical data. In operation, the classifier uses observational data from the asset to infer which physics-based models in the model library are the best candidates for the updated digital twin. The approach is demonstrated through the development of a structural digital twin for a 12ft wingspan unmanned aerial vehicle. This digital twin is built from a library of reduced-order models of the vehicle in a range of structural states. The data-driven digital twin dynamically updates in response to structural damage or degradation and enables the aircraft to replan a safe mission accordingly. Within this context, we study the performance of the optimal tree classifiers and demonstrate how their interpretability enables explainable structural assessments from sparse sensor measurements, and also informs optimal sensor placement.},

	abstract = {Accurate dynamics modeling is crucial for the safety and control of fixed-wing aircraft under perturbation (e.g. icing/fault). In this work, we propose a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (PI-NODE)-based scheme for aircraft dynamics modeling under icing/fault. First, icing accumulation and control surface faults are considered and injected into the nominal (clean) aircraft dynamics model. Second, the physics knowledge of aircraft dynamics modeling is divided into kinematics and kinetics. The former is universally applicable and borrows directly from the nominal aircraft. The latter kinetics knowledge, which hinges on external forces and moments, is inaccurate and challenging under icing/fault. To address this issue, we employ Neural ODE to compensate for the residual between the aircraft dynamics under icing/fault and the nominal (clean) condition, resulting in a naturally continuous-time modeling approach. In experiments, we benchmark the proposed PI-NODE against three baseline methods in a dedicated flight scenario. Comparative studies validate the higher accuracy and improve the generalization ability of the proposed PI-NODE for aircraft dynamics modeling under icing/fault.},

The proposed KAN-ODEs retain the flexible dynamical system modeling framework of Neural ODEs while leveraging the many benefits of KANs compared to MLPs, including higher accuracy and faster neural scaling, stronger interpretability and generalizability, and lower parameter counts. First, we quantitatively demonstrated these improvements in a comprehensive study of the classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. We then showcased the KAN-ODE framework's ability to learn symbolic source terms and complete solution profiles in higher-complexity and data-lean scenarios including wave propagation and shock formation, the complex Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation, and the Allen-Cahn phase separation equation. The successful training of KAN-ODEs, and their improved performance compared to traditional Neural ODEs, implies significant potential in leveraging this novel network architecture in myriad scientific machine learning applications for discovering hidden physics and predicting dynamic evolution.},

For Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), loss terms on initial/boundary conditions and physics equations are particularly interesting as they are well-established as highly difficult tasks. To improve learning the challenging multi-objective task posed by PINNs, we propose the ConFIG method, which provides conflict-free updates by ensuring a positive dot product between the final update and each loss-specific gradient. It also maintains consistent optimization rates for all loss terms and dynamically adjusts gradient magnitudes based on conflict levels. We additionally leverage momentum to accelerate optimizations by alternating the back-propagation of different loss terms. The proposed method is evaluated across a range of challenging PINN scenarios, consistently showing superior performance and runtime compared to baseline methods. We also test the proposed method in a classic multi-task benchmark, where the ConFIG method likewise exhibits a highly promising performance.

	abstract = {This thesis addresses the general problem of improving control, safety, and reliability of multi-rotor drones in various challenging conditions by introducing novel deep-learning-based approaches. These approaches are designed to tackle specific issues that multi-rotor drones face during operation, such as near-ground trajectory control, high-speed wind disturbances, actuation delays, and motor failures. The thesis is organized into four main chapters, plus an introduction and conclusion. Each of the main chapters focuses on a unique approach to address a particular challenge of deep-learning-based control methods. Chapter 2 presents Neural-Lander, a deep-learning-based robust nonlinear controller that significantly improves quadrotor control performance during landing by accounting for complex aerodynamic effects. This chapter addresses key challenges to incorporating learned residual dynamics into a control architecture, laying the groundwork for the subsequent chapters. Chapters 3 and 4 introduce Neural-Fly, a learning-based approach that uses Domain Adversarially Invariant Meta-Learning (DAIML) and adaptive control to enable rapid online learning and precise flight control under a wide range of wind conditions. Chapter 5 proposes a lightweight augmentation method that enhances trajectory tracking performance for UAVs by effectively compensating for motor dynamics and digital transport delays. This method is extensible to a range of control methods, including learning-based approaches. Chapter 6 explores a novel sparse failure identification method for detecting and compensating for motor failures in over-actuated UAVs, contributing to the development of robust fault detection and compensation strategies for a safer and more reliable operation. This method builds on the Neural-Fly online learning framework and extends it to handle a wider range of conditions, including complete actuator failures. Together, these chapters address key challenges in safe and reliable learning-based control and demonstrate the potential of deep-learning-based control methods.},

The recently introduced PINC framework extends PINNs to control applications, allowing for open-ended long-range prediction and control of dynamic systems. In this work, we enhance PINC for modeling highly nonlinear systems such as gas-lifted oil wells. By introducing skip connections in the PINC network and refining certain terms in the ODE, we achieve more accurate gradients during training, resulting in an effective modeling process for the oil well system. Our proposed improved PINC demonstrates superior performance, reducing the validation prediction error by an average of 67\% in the oil well application and significantly enhancing gradient flow through the network layers, increasing its magnitude by four orders of magnitude compared to the original PINC. Furthermore, experiments showcase the efficacy of Model Predictive Control (MPC) in regulating the bottom-hole pressure of the oil well using the improved PINC model, even in the presence of noisy measurements.},

	abstract = {The robotic systems continuously interact with complex dynamical systems in the physical world. Reliable predictions of spatiotemporal evolution of these dynamical systems, with limited knowledge of system dynamics, are crucial for autonomous operation. In this paper, we present HybridNet, a framework that integrates data-driven deep learning and model-driven computation to reliably predict spatiotemporal evolution of a dynamical systems even with in-exact knowledge of their parameters. A data-driven deep neural network (DNN) with Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) as the backbone is employed to predict the time-varying evolution of the external forces/perturbations. On the other hand, the model-driven computation is performed using Cellular Neural Network (CeNN), a neuro-inspired algorithm to model dynamical systems deﬁned by coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). CeNN converts the intricate numerical computation into a series of convolution operations, enabling a trainable PDE solver. With a feedback control loop, HybridNet can learn the physical parameters governing the system’s dynamics in real-time, and accordingly adapt the computation models to enhance prediction accuracy for time-evolving dynamical systems. The experimental results on two dynamical systems, namely, heat convection-diffusion system, and ﬂuid dynamical system, demonstrate that the HybridNet produces higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art deep learning based approach.},

	abstract = {Effective inclusion of physics-based knowledge into deep neural network models of dynamical systems can greatly improve data efﬁciency and generalization. Such a priori knowledge might arise from physical principles (e.g., conservation laws) or from the system’s design (e.g., the Jacobian matrix of a robot), even if large portions of the system dynamics remain unknown. We develop a framework to learn dynamics models from trajectory data while incorporating a priori system knowledge as inductive bias. More speciﬁcally, the proposed framework uses physics-based side information to inform the structure of the neural network itself, and to place constraints on the values of the outputs and the internal states of the model. It represents the system’s vector ﬁeld as a composition of known and unknown functions, the latter of which are parametrized by neural networks. The physics-informed constraints are enforced via the augmented Lagrangian method during the model’s training. We experimentally demonstrate the beneﬁts of the proposed approach on a variety of dynamical systems – including a benchmark suite of robotics environments featuring large state spaces, non-linear dynamics, external forces, contact forces, and control inputs. By exploiting a priori system knowledge during training, the proposed approach learns to predict the system dynamics two orders of magnitude more accurately than a baseline approach that does not include prior knowledge, given the same training dataset.},

For simple systems, the differential equations governing the dynamics can be derived by applying fundamental physical laws.

Data-driven modeling is an alternative paradigm that seeks to learn an approximation of the dynamics of a system using observations of the true system. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in data-driven modeling techniques, in particular neural networks have proven to provide an effective framework for solving a wide range of tasks. This paper provides a survey of the different ways to construct models of dynamical systems using neural networks. In addition to the basic overview, we review the related literature and outline the most significant challenges from numerical simulations that this modeling paradigm must overcome.

	abstract = {The explosive growth of civil applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) calls for control algorithms that enable safe and trustworthy operations, especially in complex environments to facilitate real-world deployment. Although Model-Based Control (MBC) has found great applicability in the last decades, it relies heavily on the accuracy of the underlying mathematical models. Thanks to their powerful approximation capability, datadriven approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have raised a great interest in UAV dynamical modeling in recent years. Despite the promising results achieved in learning either full or partial dynamics such as aerodynamic effects, prior studies merely pay little to no attention to the black-box nature of ANNs, yielding poorly interpretable learning processes and implying a lack of generalization capability due to undesirably learned spurious relationships among features and labels. While nowadays practitioners and society are far from being concerned just with performance, such risk evidently reduces the overall trustworthiness of the control system with ANNs as control-oriented models. With the goal of both accurate and interpretable neural modeling of nonlinear dynamics, we propose a novel modeling approach that utilizes Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), designed to seamlessly embed physical laws into Deep Neural Networks (DNN). To further enhance model interpretability, we adopt the Covariance Confidence Ellipse (CCE) as post-hoc visualization to help understand the model behavior. We also set up a visual and physical simulator based on AirSim with custom implementation on quadrotor ground effect, which is made publicly available to facilitate further experiments for the community. An extensive simulation campaign validates our approach on data sets including aerodynamics and periodic wind, highlighting advantages regarding the accuracy and physical consistency, pointing to further insight on the development of learning-based control-oriented models for quadrotors, and facilitating flight controller design with performance guarantees.},

This paper develops the first result for a deep Lyapunov-based physics-informed neural network (DeLb-PINN) architecture to adaptively control uncertain EulerLagrange systems. Lyapunov-derived weight adaptation laws provide continuous, online learning using the DeLb-PINN architecture without the need for offline training. A nonsmooth desired compensation adaptation law (DCAL) Lyapunov-based analysis is provided to guarantee global asymptotic tracking error convergence.},

	abstract = {Artiﬁcial neural networks have changed many ﬁelds by giving scientists a strong way to model complex phenomena. They are also becoming increasingly useful for solving various difﬁcult scientiﬁc problems. Still, people keep trying to ﬁnd faster and more accurate ways to simulate dynamic systems. This research explores the transformative capabilities of physics-informed neural networks, a specialized subset of artiﬁcial neural networks, in modeling complex dynamical systems with enhanced speed and accuracy. These networks incorporate known physical laws into the learning process, ensuring predictions remain consistent with fundamental principles, which is crucial when dealing with scientiﬁc phenomena. This study focuses on optimizing the application of this specialized network for simultaneous system dynamics simulations and learning time-varying parameters, particularly when the number of unknowns in the system matches the number of undetermined parameters. Additionally, we explore scenarios with a mismatch between parameters and equations, optimizing network architecture to enhance convergence speed, computational efﬁciency, and accuracy in learning the time-varying parameter. Our approach enhances the algorithm’s performance and accuracy, ensuring optimal use of computational resources and yielding more precise results. Extensive experiments are conducted on four different dynamical systems: ﬁrst-order irreversible chain reactions, biomass transfer, the Brusselsator model, and the Lotka-Volterra model, using synthetically generated data to validate our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to the susceptible-infected-recovered model, utilizing real-world COVID-19 data to learn the time-varying parameters of the pandemic’s spread. A comprehensive comparison between the performance of our approach and fully connected deep neural networks is presented, evaluating both accuracy and computational efﬁciency in parameter identiﬁcation and system dynamics capture. The results demonstrate that the physics-informed neural networks outperform fully connected deep neural networks in performance, especially with increased network depth, making them ideal for real-time complex system modeling. This underscores the physics-informed neural network’s effectiveness in scientiﬁc modeling in scenarios with balanced unknowns and parameters. Furthermore, it provides a fast, accurate, and efﬁcient alternative for analyzing dynamic systems.},

	abstract = {Collaborative robots have promising potential for widespread use in small-and-medium-sized enterprise (SME) manufacturing and production due to the development of increasingly sophisticated Human-Robot Collaboration technologies. However, predicting and identifying the behavior of collaborative robots remains a challenging problem due to the signiﬁcant non-linear properties of their unique gearbox, the harmonic drive. To tackle the engineering problem, this work proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to predict and identify collaborative robot joint dynamics. The procedure involves deriving the state-space dynamic model, embedding the system’s dynamics into a recurrent neural network (RNN) with customized Runge-Kutta cells, obtaining labeled training data, predicting system responses, and estimating dynamic parameters. The proposed method is applied to predict and identify collaborative robot joint dynamics, and the results are veriﬁed and validated through numerical simulations and experimental testing, respectively. The obtained results demonstrate a high level of agreement with the ground truth and exhibit superior performance compared to the conventional PINN and the non-linear grey-box state-space estimation algorithm when confronted with non-linearity and dynamic coupling. Moreover, the PINN exhibits the potential for extension to various dynamic systems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19736},
	abstract = {The Space Domain Awareness (SDA) community routinely tracks satellites in orbit by fitting an orbital state to observations made by the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). In order to fit such orbits, an accurate model of the forces that are acting on the satellite is required. Over the past several decades, high-quality, physics-based models have been developed for satellite state estimation and propagation. These models are exceedingly good at estimating and propagating orbital states for non-maneuvering satellites; however, there are several classes of anomalous accelerations that a satellite might experience which are not well-modeled, such as satellites that use low-thrust electric propulsion to modify their orbit. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a valuable tool for these classes of satellites as they combine physics models with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are highly expressive and versatile function approximators. By combining a physics model with a DNN, the machine learning model need not learn astrodynamics, which results in more efficient and effective utilization of machine learning resources. This paper details the application of PINNs to estimate the orbital state and a continuous, low-amplitude anomalous acceleration profile for satellites. The PINN is trained to learn the unknown acceleration by minimizing the mean square error of observations. We evaluate the performance of pure physics models with PINNs in terms of their observation residuals and their propagation accuracy beyond the fit span of the observations. For a two-day simulation of a GEO satellite using an unmodeled acceleration profile on the order of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\} {\textbackslash}text\{ km/s\}{\textasciicircum}2\$, the PINN outperformed the best-fit physics model by orders of magnitude for both observation residuals (123 arcsec vs 1.00 arcsec) as well as propagation accuracy (3860 km vs 164 km after five days).},
