\subsection{Concluding Remarks}
The journey towards fully autonomous marine robots capable of complex, long-duration missions in unstructured underwater environments is ongoing. This thesis contributes significantly by demonstrating that the principled integration of realistic simulation, advanced data-driven modeling, and sophisticated control and planning techniques, particularly within the \ac{MPC} framework, can overcome key limitations of current systems. The developed methodologies for tether-aware planning, perception-guided control, adaptive disturbance rejection, and physics-informed learning provide a solid foundation for future research and development, paving the way for safer, more capable, and more efficient autonomous marine operations. The open-source release of tools like UNav-Sim and PINC further aims to foster collaboration and accelerate progress within the marine robotics community.
