\section{Hypothesis and Research Goals}
Building on the challenges identified in applying \ac{MPC} to marine robotic inspection tasks, the core hypothesis of this thesis is formulated as follows:

Enhanced with \textbf{entaglement-aware planning}, \textbf{perception-aware control} and \textbf{data-driven modeling} \ac{MPC} enables autonomous marine robots to achieve improved trajectory tracking and inspection coverage while mitigating entanglement risks, outperforming conventional geometric planning and \ac{MPC} approaches.

%what is this hypotehsis about and why did you make it?
This hypothesis proposes that three synergistic advancements to \ac{MPC} will fundamentally improve underwater inspection systems. The proposed enhancements specifically target persistent challenges in marine robotics through:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Entanglement-aware planning:} Incorporating entanglement-aware constraints into the planning process to enhance mission safety and operational reliability.
    
      \item \textbf{Perception-aware control:} Embedding visual inspection objectives directly into the trajectory optimization process to maximize coverage quality and ensure robustness to environmental disturbances.
    
    \item \textbf{Data-driven modeling:} Leveraging learning-based approaches to capture complex and uncertain hydrodynamic effects that degrade the performance of conventional \ac{MPC} in real-world conditions.
    

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Research Goals}
The hypothesis is  be validated through development and testing of its constituent components:



\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Develop a Visually-Realistic Marine Robotics Simulation Platform:}  
Establish a synthetic testing environment bridging simulation-to-reality gaps


\item \textbf{Design Entanglement-Aware Coverage Framework:}  
Develop real-time path planning for tethered robots that accounts for entanglement risks imposed by the tether. 

\item \textbf{Formulate a Perception-Aware \ac{MPC} Framework:}  
Integrate visual inspection quality metrics directly into MPC cost functions


\item \textbf{Design Adaptive Disturbance Learning Frameworks:}  
Develop a learning-based framework for estimating external disturbances and environmental perturbations, enabling robust performance of MPC.

\end{enumerate}
