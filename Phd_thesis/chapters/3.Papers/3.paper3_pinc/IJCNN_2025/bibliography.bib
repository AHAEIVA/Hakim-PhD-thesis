Two of the main challenges remaining in DMD research are noise sensitivity and issues related to Krylov space closure when modeling nonlinear systems. Here, we investigate the combination of noise and nonlinearity in a controlled setting, by studying a class of systems with linear latent dynamics which are observed via multinomial observables. Our numerical models include system and measurement noise. We explore the influences of dataset metrics, the spectrum of the latent dynamics, the normality of the system matrix, and the geometry of the dynamics. Our results show that even for these very mildly nonlinear conditions, DMD methods often fail to recover the spectrum and can have poor predictive ability. Our work is motivated by our experience modeling multilegged robot data, where we have encountered great difficulty in reconstructing time series for oscillatory systems with slow transients, which decay only slightly faster than a period.},

A data-driven tracking control framework using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed for dynamical systems, which is particularly important when iterations or repetitions of data collection experiments are limited or even not allowed. An indirect control approach is followed to accomplish this. First, a new process model is identified using PINNs trained from a model representing the experimental data collected from the plant. Then, the DRL-based control agent utilizes the identified PINN model to deliver an offline policy. We evaluate our framework for data-driven tracking control of nonisothermal CSTR, considering measurement noise and stochastic dynamics for closed-loop control. Our approach performed comparably to an NMPC without requiring a model to predict the process dynamics.},

	abstract = {This work presents a multi-resolution physics-informed recurrent neural network (MR PI-RNN), for simultaneous prediction of musculoskeletal (MSK) motion and parameter identiﬁcation of the MSK systems. The MSK application was selected as the model problem due to its challenging nature in mapping the high-frequency surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to the low-frequency body joint motion controlled by the MSK and muscle contraction dynamics. The proposed method utilizes the fast wavelet transform to decompose the mixed frequency input sEMG and output joint motion signals into nested multi-resolution signals. The prediction model is subsequently trained on coarser-scale input–output signals using a gated recurrent unit (GRU), and then the trained parameters are transferred to the next level of training with ﬁner-scale signals. These training processes are repeated recursively under a transfer-learning fashion until the full-scale training (i.e., with unﬁltered signals) is achieved, while satisfying the underlying dynamic equilibrium. Numerical examples on recorded subject data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in generating a physics-informed forward-dynamics surrogate, which yields higher accuracy in motion predictions of elbow ﬂexion–extension of an MSK system compared to the case with single-scale training. The framework is also capable of identifying muscle parameters that are physiologically consistent with the subject’s kinematics data.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks have emerged as a prominent new method for solving diﬀerential equations. While conceptually straightforward, they often suﬀer training difﬁculties that lead to relatively large discretization errors or the failure to obtain correct solutions. In this paper we introduce invariant physics-informed neural networks for ordinary diﬀerential equations that admit a ﬁnite-dimensional group of Lie point symmetries. Using the method of equivariant moving frames, a diﬀerential equation is invariantized to obtain a, generally, simpler equation in the space of diﬀerential invariants. A solution to the invariantized equation is then mapped back to a solution of the original diﬀerential equation by solving the reconstruction equations for the left moving frame. The invariantized diﬀerential equation together with the reconstruction equations are solved using a physics-informed neural network, and form what we call an invariant physics-informed neural network. We illustrate the method with several examples, all of which considerably outperform standard non-invariant physics-informed neural networks.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the data-based modeling and optimal control of district heating systems (DHSs). Physical models of such large-scale networked systems are governed by complex nonlinear equations that require a large amount of parameters, leading to potential computational issues in optimizing their operation. A novel methodology is hence proposed, exploiting operational data and available physical knowledge to attain accurate and computationally efficient DHSs dynamic models. The proposed idea consists in leveraging multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and in embedding the physical topology of the DHS network in their interconnections. With respect to standard RNN approaches, the resulting modeling methodology, denoted as physics-informed RNN (PI-RNN), enables to achieve faster training procedures and higher modeling accuracy, even when reduced-dimension models are exploited. The developed PI-RNN modeling technique paves the way for the design of a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) regulation strategy, enabling, with limited computational time, to minimize production costs, to increase system efficiency and to respect operational constraints over the whole DHS network. The proposed methods are tested in simulation on a DHS benchmark referenced in the literature, showing promising results from the modeling and control perspective.},

We provide a unified framework in which analysis of the various components of the error incurred by PINNs in approximating PDEs can be effectively carried out. A detailed review of available results on approximation, generalization and training errors and their behavior with respect to the type of the PDE and the dimension of the underlying domain is presented. In particular, the role of the regularity of the solutions and their stability to perturbations in the error analysis is elucidated. Numerical results are also presented to illustrate the theory.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the application of Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) technique into the uncertainty identification and control issue for reentry vehicles (RV) attitude dynamics. The PINN methodology proves to obtain the solution of ordinary differential equations through incorporating the physical and data knowledges. The existing articles mainly focus on using the PINN to the inverse problem, which actually deals with the open-loop dynamics and neglects the control design. Different from that, this paper instead introduces the Euler iteration-augmented Physics-Informed Neural Networks (Euler-PINNs) to estimate unknown parameters in the RV closed-loop dynamics, meanwhile, the classical PID is designed to ensure the fine attitude track of desired commands. Furthermore, the framework of the proposed method is described in detail. Then, the sampled simulated time-series data of attitude dynamics with time-varying uncertainties is utilized for the neural network learning, and simulation results show its effectiveness. Also, the influence of control parameters on the PINN algorithm effect is discussed.},

	abstract = {Vehicle dynamics modeling is a crucial task for the trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles. Due to the variable road conditions and the high cost of data acquisition, both physics-based and data-driven models face significant challenges with sparse data. To address this issue, we propose a vehicle model that combines the single-track model with physics-informed neural network methods. Firstly, we encode the single-track model in a physics-based computational graph to identify the key parameters in the physical model. Then, we use these parameters to calibrate the single-track model, which is again encoded in a physics-based computational graph to design a physics-informed neural network for vehicle dynamics modeling (PINN-VM). The PINN-VM leverages the advantages of model-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve accurate vehicle dynamics modeling. Compared to models without physics, PINN-VM performs better, especially in situations with sparse data. Finally, the PINN-VM is incorporated into a novel model predictive control framework to design a trajectory tracking controller. Simulation experiments using CarSim and Simulink demonstrate that the proposed controller enhances trajectory tracking performance and lateral stability under the condition of large curvature at medium-high velocity with different friction coefficients.},

	abstract = {This paper exploits a new direction of structural identiﬁcation by means of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), particularly constrained by domain knowledge, such as structural dynamics, thus forming Physics-informed Neural ODEs, aiming at governing equations discovery/approximation. Structural identiﬁcation problems often entail complex setups featuring high-dimensionality, or stiff ODEs, which pose diﬃculties in the training and learning of conventional data-driven algorithms who seek to unveil the governing dynamics of a system of interest. In this work, Neural ODEs are re-casted as a two-level representation involving a physics-informed term, that stems from possible prior knowledge of a dynamical system, and a discrepancy term, captured by means of a feedforward neural network. The re-casted format is highly adaptive and ﬂexible to structural monitoring problems, such as linear/nonlinear structural identiﬁcation, model updating, structural damage detection, driving force identiﬁcation, etc. As an added step, for inferring an explainable model, we propose the adoption of sparse identiﬁcation of nonlinear dynamical systems as an additional tool to distill closed-form expressions for the trained nets, that embed a more straightforward engineering interpretation. We demonstrate the framework on a series of numerical and experimental examples, with the latter pertaining to a structural system featuring highly nonlinear behavior, which is successfully learned by the proposed framework. The proposed structural identiﬁcation with Physics-informed Neural ODEs comes with the beneﬁts of direct approximation of the governing dynamics, and a versatile and ﬂexible framework for discrepancy modeling in structural identiﬁcation problems.},

Neural network (NN)-based approximations have attracted significant interest due to fast evaluation with good accuracy over long integration time steps. In contrast to established numerical approximation schemes such as Runge-Kutta methods, the estimation of the error of the NN-based approximations proves to be difficult. In this work, we propose to use the NN's predictions in a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) method. The residuals in the implicit system of equations can be related to the NN's prediction error, hence, we can provide an error estimate at several points along a trajectory. We find that this error estimate highly correlates with the NN's prediction error and that increasing the order of the IRK method improves this estimate. We demonstrate this estimation methodology for Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) on the logistic equation as an illustrative example and then apply it to a four-state electric generator model that is regularly used in power system modelling.},

	doi = {10.1109/LRA.2024.3446287},
	abstract = {Accurately modeling soft robots in simulation is computationally expensive and commonly falls short of representing the real world. This well-known discrepancy, known as the sim-to-real gap, can have several causes, such as coarsely approximated geometry and material models, manufacturing defects, viscoelasticity and plasticity, and hysteresis effects. Residual physics networks learn from real-world data to augment a discrepant model and bring it closer to reality. Here, we present a residual physics method for modeling soft robots with large degrees of freedom. We train neural networks to learn a residual term — the modeling error between simulated and physical systems. Concretely, the residual term is a force applied on the whole simulated mesh, while real position data is collected with only sparse motion markers. The physical prior of the analytical simulation provides a starting point for the residual network, and the combined model is more informed than if physics were learned tabula rasa. We demonstrate our method on 1) a silicone elastomeric beam and 2) a soft pneumatic arm with hard-to-model, anisotropic fiber reinforcements. Our method outperforms traditional system identification up to 60\%. We show that residual physics need not be limited to low degrees of freedom but can effectively bridge the sim-to-real gap for high dimensional systems.},

Higher order complex beam PDEs are efficiently solved for forward problems to compute the transverse displacements and cross-sectional rotations with less than 1e-3 \% error. Furthermore, inverse problems are robustly solved to determine the unknown dimensionless model parameters and applied force in the entire space–time domain, even in the case of noisy data.

	abstract = {Recent advances in aerial robotics have enabled the use of multirotor vehicles for autonomous payload transportation. Resorting only to classical methods to reliably model a quadrotor carrying a cable-slung load poses significant challenges. On the other hand, purely data-driven learning methods do not comply by design with the problem’s physical constraints, especially in states that are not densely represented in training data. In this work, we explore the use of physicsinformed neural networks to learn an end-to-end model of the multirotor-slung-load system and, at a given time, estimate a sequence of the future system states. An LSTM encoderdecoder with an attention mechanism is used to capture the dynamics of the system. To guarantee the cohesiveness between the multiple predicted states of the system, we propose the use of a physics-based term in the loss function, which includes a discretized physical model derived from first principles together with slack variables that allow for a small mismatch between expected and predicted values. To train the model, a dataset using a real-world quadrotor carrying a slung load was curated and is made available. Prediction results are presented and corroborate the feasibility of the approach. The proposed method outperforms both the first principles physical model and a comparable neural network model trained without the physics regularization proposed.},

Therefore, it is crucial to model the dynamics of collaborative robots during pHRI to gain valuable insights into the system’s behavior when in contact with humans. In this work, a generic dynamic model is proposed for the quasi-static contact phase of pHRI, which considers the interaction dynamics and the complete structural dynamics of the collaborative robot. Moreover, a hybrid physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed, which utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) and the Runge–Kutta method to identify the joint dynamic parameters without complicated regressor construction. Experiments are conducted using a UR3e collaborative robot, and the PINN is trained using the acquired data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PINN in identifying joint dynamics without prior knowledge, and the dynamic simulation of pHRI is consistent with the experimental results.

PINNs for control (PINCs) of dynamical systems are gaining interest due to their prediction speed compared to classical numerical integration methods for nonlinear state-space models, making them suitable for real-time control applications. We introduce the domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) to address current limitations of PINC in handling large and complex nonlinear dynamic systems. The time domain is decoupled from the feed-forward neural network to construct an Ansatz function, allowing for calculation of gradients in closed form. This approach significantly reduces training times, especially for large dynamical systems, compared to PINC, which relies on graph-based automatic differentiation. Additionally, the DD-PINN inherently fulfills the initial condition and supports higher-order excitation inputs, simplifying the training process and enabling improved prediction accuracy. Validation on three systems - a nonlinear mass-spring-damper, a five-mass-chain, and a two-link robot - demonstrates that the DD-PINN achieves significantly shorter training times. In cases where the PINC's prediction diverges, the DD-PINN's prediction remains stable and accurate due to higher physics loss reduction or use of a higher-order excitation input. The DD-PINN allows for fast and accurate learning of large dynamical systems previously out of reach for the PINC.},

As a model-based optimal control technique, the performance of MPC strongly depends on the model used where a trade-off between model computation time and prediction performance exists. One solution is the integration of MPC with a machine learning (ML) based process model which are quick to evaluate online. This work presents the experimental implementation of a deep neural network (DNN) based nonlinear MPC for Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion control. The DNN model consists of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network surrounded by fully connected layers which was trained using experimental engine data and showed acceptable prediction performance with under 5\% error for all outputs. Using this model, the MPC is designed to track the Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) and combustion phasing trajectories, while minimizing several parameters. Using the acados software package to enable the real-time implementation of the MPC on an ARM Cortex A72, the optimization calculations are completed within 1.4 ms. The external A72 processor is integrated with the prototyping engine controller using a UDP connection allowing for rapid experimental deployment of the NMPC.

	abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a state-of-the-art (SOTA) control technique which requires solving hard constrained optimization problems iteratively. For uncertain dynamics, analytical model based robust MPC imposes additional constraints, increasing the hardness of the problem. The problem exacerbates in performance-critical applications, when more compute is required in lesser time. Data-driven regression methods such as Neural Networks have been proposed in the past to approximate system dynamics. However, such models rely on high volumes of labeled data, in the absence of symbolic analytical priors. This incurs non-trivial training overheads. Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained traction for approximating non-linear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), with reasonable accuracy. In this work, we propose a Robust Adaptive MPC framework via PINNs (RAMP-Net), which uses a neural network trained partly from simple ODEs and partly from data. A physics loss is used to learn simple ODEs representing ideal dynamics. Having access to analytical functions inside the loss function acts as a regularizer, enforcing robust behavior for parametric uncertainties. On the other hand, a regular data loss is used for adapting to residual disturbances (non-parametric uncertainties), unaccounted during mathematical modelling. Experiments are performed in a simulated environment for trajectory tracking of a quadrotor. We report 7.8\% to 43.2\% and 8.04\% to 61.5\% reduction in tracking errors for speeds ranging from 0.5 to 1.75 m/s compared to two SOTA regression based MPC methods.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has been widely used within learning algorithms for robotics. One disadvantage of deep networks is that these networks are black-box representations. Therefore, the learned approximations ignore the existing knowledge of physics or robotics. Especially for learning dynamics models, these black-box models are not desirable as the underlying principles are well understood and the standard deep networks can learn dynamics that violate these principles. To learn dynamics models with deep networks that guarantee physically plausible dynamics, we introduce physics-inspired deep networks that combine first principles from physics with deep learning. We incorporate Lagrangian mechanics within the model learning such that all approximated models adhere to the laws of physics and conserve energy. Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) parametrize the system energy using two networks. The parameters are obtained by minimizing the squared residual of the Euler–Lagrange differential equation. Therefore, the resulting model does not require specific knowledge of the individual system, is interpretable, and can be used as a forward, inverse, and energy model. Previously these properties were only obtained when using system identification techniques that require knowledge of the kinematic structure. We apply DeLaN to learning dynamics models and apply these models to control simulated and physical rigid body systems. The results show that the proposed approach obtains dynamics models that can be applied to physical systems for real-time control. Compared to standard deep networks, the physics-inspired models learn better models and capture the underlying structure of the dynamics.},

Modeling and control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with four rotors fall into that category of problems. In this paper, a nonlinear quadrotor UAV dynamical model is developed with the Newton–Euler method, and a control architecture is proposed for 3D trajectory tracking. The controller design is decoupled into two parts: an inner loop for attitude stabilization and an outer loop for trajectory tracking. A few attitude stabilization methods are discussed, implemented and compared, considering the following control approaches: Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID), Linear–Quadratic Regulator (LQR), Model Predictive Control (MPC), Feedback Linearization (FL) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC). This paper is intended to serve as a guideline work for selecting quadcopters’ control strategies, both in terms of quantitative and qualitative considerations. PID and LQR controllers are designed, exploiting the model linearized about the hovering condition, while MPC, FL and SMC directly exploit the nonlinear model, with minor simplifications. The fast dynamics ensured by the SMC-based controller together with its robustness and the limited estimated command effort of the controller make it the most promising controller for quadrotor attitude stabilization. The outer loop consists of three independent PID controllers: one for altitude control and the other two, together with a dynamics’ inversion, are entitled to the computation of the reference attitude for the inner loop. The capability of the controlled closed-loop system of executing complex trajectories is demonstrated by means of simulations in MATLAB/Simulink®.},

We propose algorithms for model-based policy iterations to solve nonlinear optimal control problems with convergence guarantees. The main component of our approach is an iterative procedure that utilizes neural approximations to solve linear partial differential equations (PDEs), ensuring convergence. We present two variants of the algorithms. The first variant formulates the optimization problem as a linear least square problem, drawing inspiration from extreme learning machine (ELM) for solving PDEs. This variant efficiently handles low-dimensional problems with high accuracy. The second variant is based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving PDEs and has the potential to address high-dimensional problems. We demonstrate that both algorithms outperform traditional approaches, such as Galerkin methods, by a significant margin. We provide a theoretical analysis of both algorithms in terms of convergence of neural approximations towards the true optimal solutions in a general setting. Furthermore, we employ formal verification techniques to demonstrate the verifiable stability of the resulting controllers.},

	abstract = {Predictive modeling of various systems around the world is extremely essential from the physics and engineering perspectives. The recognition of different systems and the capacity to predict their future behavior can lead to numerous significant applications. For the most part, physics is frequently used to model different systems. Using physical modeling can also very well help the resolution of complexity and achieve superior performance with the emerging field of novel artificial intelligence and the challenges associated with it. Physical modeling provides data and knowledge that offer a meaningful and complementary understanding about the system. So, by using enriched data and training phases, the overall general integrated model achieves enhanced accuracy. The effectiveness of hybrid physics-guided or machine learning-guided models has been validated by experimental results of diverse use cases. Increased accuracy, interpretability, and transparency are the results of such hybrid models. In this article, we provide a detailed overview of how machine learning and physics can be integrated into an interactive approach. Regarding this, we propose a classification of possible interactions between physical modeling and machine learning techniques. Our classification includes three types of approaches: (1)\&nbsp;physics-guided machine learning (2)\&nbsp;machine learning-guided physics, and (3)\&nbsp;mutually-guided physics and ML. We studied the models and specifications for each of these three approaches in-depth for this survey.},

	abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-0384.vidPhysics-Infused Machine Learning (PIML) architectures aim at integrating machine learning with computationally-efficient, low-fidelity (partial) physics models, leading to improved generalizability, extrapolability, and robustness to noise, compared to pure data-driven approximation models. End-uses of PIML include, but are not limited to, model-based optimization and model-predictive control. Recently a new PIML architecture was reported by the same authors, known as Opportunistic Physics-mining Transfer Mapping Architecture or OPTMA, which transfers the original inputs into latent features using a transfer neural network; the partial physics model then uses the latent features to generate the final output that is as close as possible to the high-fidelity output. While gradient-free solvers and back-propagation with supervised learning (where optimum labels are pre-generated) have been used to train OPTMA, that approach remains computationally inefficient, and challenging to generalize across different problems or exploit state-of-the-art machine learning architectures. This paper aims to alleviate these issues by infusing the partial physics model inside the neural network, as described via tensors in the popular machine learning framework, PyTorch. Such a description also naturally allows auto-differentiation of the partial physics model, thereby enabling the use of efficient back-propagation methods to train the transfer network. The benefits of the upgraded OPTMA architecture with Automatic Differentiation (OPTMA-Net) is demonstrated by applying it to the problem of modeling the sound pressure field created by a hovering unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Ground truth data for this problem has been obtained from an indoor UAV noise measurement setup. Here, the partial physics model is based on the interference of acoustic pressure waves generated by an arbitrary number of acoustic monopole sources. Case studies show that OPTMA-Net provides generalization performance close to, and extrapolation performance that is 4 times better than, those given by a pure data-driven model.},

	abstract = {This work develops a methodology for creating a data-driven digital twin from a library of physics-based models representing various asset states. The digital twin is updated using interpretable machine learning. Specifically, we use optimal trees---a recently developed scalable machine learning method---to train an interpretable data-driven classifier. Training data for the classifier are generated offline using simulated scenarios solved by the library of physics-based models. These data can be further augmented using experimental or other historical data. In operation, the classifier uses observational data from the asset to infer which physics-based models in the model library are the best candidates for the updated digital twin. The approach is demonstrated through the development of a structural digital twin for a 12ft wingspan unmanned aerial vehicle. This digital twin is built from a library of reduced-order models of the vehicle in a range of structural states. The data-driven digital twin dynamically updates in response to structural damage or degradation and enables the aircraft to replan a safe mission accordingly. Within this context, we study the performance of the optimal tree classifiers and demonstrate how their interpretability enables explainable structural assessments from sparse sensor measurements, and also informs optimal sensor placement.},

In this work, we propose a physics-informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (PI-NODE)-based scheme for aircraft dynamics modeling under icing/fault. First, icing accumulation and control surface faults are considered and injected into the nominal (clean) aircraft dynamics model. Second, the physics knowledge of aircraft dynamics modeling is divided into kinematics and kinetics. The former is universally applicable and borrows directly from the nominal aircraft. The latter kinetics knowledge, which hinges on external forces and moments, is inaccurate and challenging under icing/fault. To address this issue, we employ Neural ODE to compensate for the residual between the aircraft dynamics under icing/fault and the nominal (clean) condition, resulting in a naturally continuous-time modeling approach. In experiments, we benchmark the proposed PI-NODE against three baseline methods in a dedicated flight scenario. Comparative studies validate the higher accuracy and improve the generalization ability of the proposed PI-NODE for aircraft dynamics modeling under icing/fault.},

The proposed KAN-ODEs retain the flexible dynamical system modeling framework of Neural ODEs while leveraging the many benefits of KANs compared to MLPs, including higher accuracy and faster neural scaling, stronger interpretability and generalizability, and lower parameter counts. First, we quantitatively demonstrated these improvements in a comprehensive study of the classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. We then showcased the KAN-ODE framework's ability to learn symbolic source terms and complete solution profiles in higher-complexity and data-lean scenarios including wave propagation and shock formation, the complex Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation, and the Allen-Cahn phase separation equation. The successful training of KAN-ODEs, and their improved performance compared to traditional Neural ODEs, implies significant potential in leveraging this novel network architecture in myriad scientific machine learning applications for discovering hidden physics and predicting dynamic evolution.},

For Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), loss terms on initial/boundary conditions and physics equations are particularly interesting as they are well-established as highly difficult tasks. To improve learning the challenging multi-objective task posed by PINNs, we propose the ConFIG method, which provides conflict-free updates by ensuring a positive dot product between the final update and each loss-specific gradient. It also maintains consistent optimization rates for all loss terms and dynamically adjusts gradient magnitudes based on conflict levels. We additionally leverage momentum to accelerate optimizations by alternating the back-propagation of different loss terms. The proposed method is evaluated across a range of challenging PINN scenarios, consistently showing superior performance and runtime compared to baseline methods. We also test the proposed method in a classic multi-task benchmark, where the ConFIG method likewise exhibits a highly promising performance.

These approaches are designed to tackle specific issues that multi-rotor drones face during operation, such as near-ground trajectory control, high-speed wind disturbances, actuation delays, and motor failures. The thesis is organized into four main chapters, plus an introduction and conclusion. Each of the main chapters focuses on a unique approach to address a particular challenge of deep-learning-based control methods. Chapter 2 presents Neural-Lander, a deep-learning-based robust nonlinear controller that significantly improves quadrotor control performance during landing by accounting for complex aerodynamic effects. This chapter addresses key challenges to incorporating learned residual dynamics into a control architecture, laying the groundwork for the subsequent chapters. Chapters 3 and 4 introduce Neural-Fly, a learning-based approach that uses Domain Adversarially Invariant Meta-Learning (DAIML) and adaptive control to enable rapid online learning and precise flight control under a wide range of wind conditions. Chapter 5 proposes a lightweight augmentation method that enhances trajectory tracking performance for UAVs by effectively compensating for motor dynamics and digital transport delays. This method is extensible to a range of control methods, including learning-based approaches. Chapter 6 explores a novel sparse failure identification method for detecting and compensating for motor failures in over-actuated UAVs, contributing to the development of robust fault detection and compensation strategies for a safer and more reliable operation. This method builds on the Neural-Fly online learning framework and extends it to handle a wider range of conditions, including complete actuator failures. Together, these chapters address key challenges in safe and reliable learning-based control and demonstrate the potential of deep-learning-based control methods.},

In this paper, we present HybridNet, a framework that integrates data-driven deep learning and model-driven computation to reliably predict spatiotemporal evolution of a dynamical systems even with in-exact knowledge of their parameters. A data-driven deep neural network (DNN) with Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) as the backbone is employed to predict the time-varying evolution of the external forces/perturbations. On the other hand, the model-driven computation is performed using Cellular Neural Network (CeNN), a neuro-inspired algorithm to model dynamical systems deﬁned by coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). CeNN converts the intricate numerical computation into a series of convolution operations, enabling a trainable PDE solver. With a feedback control loop, HybridNet can learn the physical parameters governing the system’s dynamics in real-time, and accordingly adapt the computation models to enhance prediction accuracy for time-evolving dynamical systems. The experimental results on two dynamical systems, namely, heat convection-diffusion system, and ﬂuid dynamical system, demonstrate that the HybridNet produces higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art deep learning based approach.},

Such a priori knowledge might arise from physical principles (e.g., conservation laws) or from the system’s design (e.g., the Jacobian matrix of a robot), even if large portions of the system dynamics remain unknown. We develop a framework to learn dynamics models from trajectory data while incorporating a priori system knowledge as inductive bias. More speciﬁcally, the proposed framework uses physics-based side information to inform the structure of the neural network itself, and to place constraints on the values of the outputs and the internal states of the model. It represents the system’s vector ﬁeld as a composition of known and unknown functions, the latter of which are parametrized by neural networks. The physics-informed constraints are enforced via the augmented Lagrangian method during the model’s training. We experimentally demonstrate the beneﬁts of the proposed approach on a variety of dynamical systems – including a benchmark suite of robotics environments featuring large state spaces, non-linear dynamics, external forces, contact forces, and control inputs.

Although Model-Based Control (MBC) has found great applicability in the last decades, it relies heavily on the accuracy of the underlying mathematical models. Thanks to their powerful approximation capability, datadriven approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have raised a great interest in UAV dynamical modeling in recent years. Despite the promising results achieved in learning either full or partial dynamics such as aerodynamic effects, prior studies merely pay little to no attention to the black-box nature of ANNs, yielding poorly interpretable learning processes and implying a lack of generalization capability due to undesirably learned spurious relationships among features and labels. While nowadays practitioners and society are far from being concerned just with performance, such risk evidently reduces the overall trustworthiness of the control system with ANNs as control-oriented models. With the goal of both accurate and interpretable neural modeling of nonlinear dynamics, we propose a novel modeling approach that utilizes Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), designed to seamlessly embed physical laws into Deep Neural Networks (DNN). To further enhance model interpretability, we adopt the Covariance Confidence Ellipse (CCE) as post-hoc visualization to help understand the model behavior. We also set up a visual and physical simulator based on AirSim with custom implementation on quadrotor ground effect, which is made publicly available to facilitate further experiments for the community. An extensive simulation campaign validates our approach on data sets including aerodynamics and periodic wind, highlighting advantages regarding the accuracy and physical consistency, pointing to further insight on the development of learning-based control-oriented models for quadrotors, and facilitating flight controller design with performance guarantees.},

Recent developments have produced physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) which are neural networks designed to be constrained by known physical principles. However, developing real-time adaptive control methods with stability guarantees for PINNs remains an open problem. This paper develops the first result for a deep Lyapunov-based physics-informed neural network (DeLb-PINN) architecture to adaptively control uncertain EulerLagrange systems. Lyapunov-derived weight adaptation laws provide continuous, online learning using the DeLb-PINN architecture without the need for offline training. A nonsmooth desired compensation adaptation law (DCAL) Lyapunov-based analysis is provided to guarantee global asymptotic tracking error convergence.},

	abstract = {Artiﬁcial neural networks have changed many ﬁelds by giving scientists a strong way to model complex phenomena. They are also becoming increasingly useful for solving various difﬁcult scientiﬁc problems. Still, people keep trying to ﬁnd faster and more accurate ways to simulate dynamic systems. This research explores the transformative capabilities of physics-informed neural networks, a specialized subset of artiﬁcial neural networks, in modeling complex dynamical systems with enhanced speed and accuracy. These networks incorporate known physical laws into the learning process, ensuring predictions remain consistent with fundamental principles, which is crucial when dealing with scientiﬁc phenomena. This study focuses on optimizing the application of this specialized network for simultaneous system dynamics simulations and learning time-varying parameters, particularly when the number of unknowns in the system matches the number of undetermined parameters. Additionally, we explore scenarios with a mismatch between parameters and equations, optimizing network architecture to enhance convergence speed, computational efﬁciency, and accuracy in learning the time-varying parameter. Our approach enhances the algorithm’s performance and accuracy, ensuring optimal use of computational resources and yielding more precise results. Extensive experiments are conducted on four different dynamical systems: ﬁrst-order irreversible chain reactions, biomass transfer, the Brusselsator model, and the Lotka-Volterra model, using synthetically generated data to validate our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to the susceptible-infected-recovered model, utilizing real-world COVID-19 data to learn the time-varying parameters of the pandemic’s spread. A comprehensive comparison between the performance of our approach and fully connected deep neural networks is presented, evaluating both accuracy and computational efﬁciency in parameter identiﬁcation and system dynamics capture. The results demonstrate that the physics-informed neural networks outperform fully connected deep neural networks in performance, especially with increased network depth, making them ideal for real-time complex system modeling. This underscores the physics-informed neural network’s effectiveness in scientiﬁc modeling in scenarios with balanced unknowns and parameters. Furthermore, it provides a fast, accurate, and efﬁcient alternative for analyzing dynamic systems.},

	abstract = {Collaborative robots have promising potential for widespread use in small-and-medium-sized enterprise (SME) manufacturing and production due to the development of increasingly sophisticated Human-Robot Collaboration technologies. However, predicting and identifying the behavior of collaborative robots remains a challenging problem due to the signiﬁcant non-linear properties of their unique gearbox, the harmonic drive. To tackle the engineering problem, this work proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to predict and identify collaborative robot joint dynamics. The procedure involves deriving the state-space dynamic model, embedding the system’s dynamics into a recurrent neural network (RNN) with customized Runge-Kutta cells, obtaining labeled training data, predicting system responses, and estimating dynamic parameters. The proposed method is applied to predict and identify collaborative robot joint dynamics, and the results are veriﬁed and validated through numerical simulations and experimental testing, respectively. The obtained results demonstrate a high level of agreement with the ground truth and exhibit superior performance compared to the conventional PINN and the non-linear grey-box state-space estimation algorithm when confronted with non-linearity and dynamic coupling. Moreover, the PINN exhibits the potential for extension to various dynamic systems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19736},
	abstract = {The Space Domain Awareness (SDA) community routinely tracks satellites in orbit by fitting an orbital state to observations made by the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). In order to fit such orbits, an accurate model of the forces that are acting on the satellite is required. Over the past several decades, high-quality, physics-based models have been developed for satellite state estimation and propagation. These models are exceedingly good at estimating and propagating orbital states for non-maneuvering satellites; however, there are several classes of anomalous accelerations that a satellite might experience which are not well-modeled, such as satellites that use low-thrust electric propulsion to modify their orbit. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a valuable tool for these classes of satellites as they combine physics models with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are highly expressive and versatile function approximators. By combining a physics model with a DNN, the machine learning model need not learn astrodynamics, which results in more efficient and effective utilization of machine learning resources. This paper details the application of PINNs to estimate the orbital state and a continuous, low-amplitude anomalous acceleration profile for satellites. The PINN is trained to learn the unknown acceleration by minimizing the mean square error of observations. We evaluate the performance of pure physics models with PINNs in terms of their observation residuals and their propagation accuracy beyond the fit span of the observations. For a two-day simulation of a GEO satellite using an unmodeled acceleration profile on the order of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\} {\textbackslash}text\{ km/s\}{\textasciicircum}2\$, the PINN outperformed the best-fit physics model by orders of magnitude for both observation residuals (123 arcsec vs 1.00 arcsec) as well as propagation accuracy (3860 km vs 164 km after five days).},
