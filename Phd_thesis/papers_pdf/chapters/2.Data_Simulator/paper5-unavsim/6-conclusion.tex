\section{Conclusion \& future work} \label{sec:unavsim:conclusion}
We have developed UNav-Sim, a novel open-source underwater simulator, which builds upon AirSim and \ac{UE5} and incorporates state-of-the-art robotics algorithms. UNav-Sim also supports \ac{ROS} and multiple operating systems, facilitating a streamlined and efficient development process for robotics applications. Future work will include the incorporation of additional underwater sensors, vehicle models, and more custom environments.
