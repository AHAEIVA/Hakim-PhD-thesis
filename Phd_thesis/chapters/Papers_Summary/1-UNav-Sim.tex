\chapter{Advanced Marine Robotics Simulation}
In this chapter, we address the critical need of visually realistic and customizable simulation tools in marine robotics. Compared to other robotics simulators, underwater simulators often suffer from limited rendering fidelity, poor underwater physics modeling, and weak integration with standard robotics tools such as ROS. To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive survey of existing underwater simulators to identify their limitations and inform the design of a new tool.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce UNav-Sim, a novel, open-source underwater robotics simulator designed to support advanced autonomy and vision-based algorithms. UNav-Sim is the first underwater simulator to leverage Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) for high-fidelity visual environments while supporting essential robotics frameworks like ROS 2 and autopilot software. Built on top of AirSim, UNav-Sim enables rapid development and testing of underwater perception, navigation, and control algorithms. The framework includes a vision-based navigation stack and supports various sensor modalities, making it well-suited for both academic and industrial research.

Since its release, UNav-Sim has been widely adopted by the underwater robotics community, becoming a go-to tool for realistic simulation and synthetic data generation. Future development will focus on expanding the suite of supported sensors, vehicle models, and customizable underwater environments.
