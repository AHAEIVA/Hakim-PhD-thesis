\section{Research questions}
\label{sec:intro:researchquestions}

This PhD thesis aims to enhance underwater robots' capabilities through improved visual-aided navigation systems using deep learning techniques. This section delineates the specific research questions that guide the steps to follow toward that goal. These questions align with the goals of the REMARO project on developing reliable AI methods for perception:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Where does the current state-of-the-art for visual localization methods lie?
    \item What is the gap between geometry-based and deep learning-based visual localization methods?
    \item How can deep learning techniques be optimized for the unique visual conditions of underwater environments?
    \item What role does synthetic data play in training deep learning models for underwater visual navigation?
    \item How can deep learning architectures be designed to enhance localization accuracy and model generalizability?
    \item What architectures can minimize deep learning data requirements for visual-based localization models?
    \item How can these methods be safely integrated into real AUV missions?
    \item What is the future of vision sensing underwater?

\end{enumerate}
